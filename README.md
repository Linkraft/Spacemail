Spacemail is a VR spaceship action game developed by the UF MiDAS cohort during the fall semester of 2020. It utilizes Oculus's hand tracking for 100% of the interactions, including steering of the ship, menu navigation, firing of weapons, and so on.

# Story
You are a Spacemail carrier en route to transport vital resources to nearby planets. Suddenly, three ships surround and engage your ship with their tractor beams, siphoning your supplies from your vessel and quickly hyperjumping away. Lousy space pirates! Without those resources, the populations of three planets will die! You set your navigational system to pursue the space pirates, and ready your ship for an arduous fight.

# Controls
The ship's steering is controlled by a state-of-the-art SphereTrack control orb, situated in the center of the ship's console. Simply roll the orb in the direction you wish your ship to move in an XY-plane, and the ship will move accordingly:

Your Spacemail vessel comes equipped with a hyperbeam laser cannon and a ion blaster, controlled by the following:

To fire the ion blaster, simply press the button in the top right of your control console.

To fire the hyperbeam laser cannon, pull down on the lever to the right of your SphereTrack orb. Be aware that there is a cooldown between volleys, so only use this weapon when in a tight spot.

Your vessel also comes outfitted with aesthetic but nonetheless vital controls concerning the music and lighting filling your cockpit:
